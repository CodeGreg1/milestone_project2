Milestone project 2 Javascript game - Carnival Shooting Gallery


<h1 align="center">Greg Goodrem Milestone Project 2</h1>

This project is designed as a shooting gallery game for fun. This game is constructed with my correct knowledge level of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The goal of the game is to shoot the targets as quickly as you can during the 20 second time limit.
